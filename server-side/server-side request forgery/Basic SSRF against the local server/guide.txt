Go the a product's page and check the stop by clicking on the button.

Note the request includes a URL, presumably where the server sends a
request to ask for the stock.

Intercept such request and change the URL to http://localhost/admin

The page returned has an option to delete user carlos, click on it. It
will fail as our client cannot make such request, but now we got the
request performing such action.

Intercept again our request checking for the stock and change the URL
to http://localhost/<URL performing the deletion>. Check poc.txt
